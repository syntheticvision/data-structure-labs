# Reflection for Lab 1

What I Liked About Python is its simplicity, readability, and clean syntax make coding quick and enjoyable. I also like its memory management and dynamic typing which make things easier.

But what I didn't like about Python is that sometimes it's harder to understand what is going on under the hood and also it could be slower during runtime compared to C/C++.

Python is dynamically typed and compared to statically typed C/C++ it is both easier and harder to manage. Because in C/C++ types must be declared and this way we can catch errors easier however Python makes it easier to just write code and not worry too much about all the details.

Similarities and Differences with C/C++ is that both languages share basic programming concepts, but Python's dynamic typing, automatic memory management, and ease of use is very different compared to C/C++â€™s strict typing, manual memory allocation and just an overall more robust structure.
